This is the version of mapSpecies that is hosted on the IELAB gitlab. I just realized that old commit won't appear here, so a real migration should be made soon. I just need this repo here since the external address of the IELAB gitlab server is closed.

This is an R package that is designed to build species distribution for the Observatoire des écosystèmes.

Currently, the R package depends on the ``INLA`` R package and is essentially a specialized wrapper of ``INLA`` to construct species distribution maps based on how different data type.
